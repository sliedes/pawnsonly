This program solves the Pawn Game (pawn-only chess) for NxN chess
boards. For the rules of the Pawn Game, see [1]. The solver is
efficient enough to solve a 7x7 game in roughly a minute.

"Solving" a game means determining the result when both players play
perfectly. It turns out that for 4x4 and 5x5 boards, the game is a win
for the white player while for 6x6 and 7x7 boards the result is a
draw.

[For chess enthusiasts, there is one caveat: The current
implementation does not support the en passant capture. It's not
impossible to support, just not implemented.]

I developed the program originally in 2012 just to satisfy my
curiosity, so the output is unfortunately not terribly
self-documenting.
